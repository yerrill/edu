## Outline

- Users and groups
- Permissions and access control
- Running commands with privilege
- Authentication

## User and Group

### Users

- In Linux, each user is assigned a unique user ID
- User ID is stored in `/etc/passwd`

```Bash
root:x:0:0:/root:/bin/bash
seed:x:1000:1000:SEED,,,:/home/seed:/bin/bash
```

- Find user ID

```Bash
seed@VM:~ id
uid=1000(seed) gid=1000(seed) groups=1000(seed)

root@VM:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

### Add Users & Switch to Other Users

- Add users
  - Directly add to `/etc/password`
  - Use `adduser` command
- Switch to another user

```Bash
seed@VM:~ su bob
Password:
bob@VM:/home/seed$ id
```

### Group

- Represent a collection of users
- Assigning permissions based on group
- A user can belong to multiple groups
- A user’s primary group is in /etc/passwd

```Bash
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
seed:x:1000:1000:SEED,,,:/home/seed:/bin/bash
bob:x:1001:1001:Bob,,,:/home/bob:/bin/bash
alice:x:1002:1003:Alice,,,:/home/alice:/bin/bash
```

### Which Group Does a User Belong To?

### Group Management

How to add users

```Bash
sudo groupadd alpha                 # Create a group alpha
sudo usermod -a -G alpha seed       # Add seed to alpha
sudo usermod -a -G bob              # add bob to alpha
```

## Permissions and Access Control

### Access Control

- Computer system is a collection of
  - Resources or **objects**
  - Users or **subjects**
- Access control
  - Field of computer security that defines that way the subjects access the objects.
  - Discretionary access control (**DAC**)
    - Access control list (ACL) and Capability list.
  - Role-based access control (**RBAC**)
  - Mandatory access control (**MAC**)
  - Attributed-based access control (**ABAC**) or policy-based access control

### Traditional Permission Model

- Types of access on **files**
  - **read (r)**: users can view the contents of the file
  - **write (w)**: users can change the contents of the file
  - **execute (x)**: user can execute or run the files if it is a program or script
- Types of access on **directories**
  - **read (r)**: user can list the contents of the directory (e.g. using `ls`)
  - **write (w)**: user can create files and sub-directories inside the directory
  - **execute (x)**: user can enter that directory (e.g. using `cd`)

### Files

### Decoding the mode

- `chmod` to change the permissions of a file or directory.
- **Absolute mode**
  - Use the numeric system.
  - `chmod 755 somefile`
  - What would `640` mean?
- **Relative mode**
  - user (u), group (g), and others (o).
  - `+` sign to add a permission
  - `-` sign to remove a permission
  - `r` , `w`, `x` to specify what permissions you want to set.
  - `chmod +x somefile`
  - `chmod u+rwx`,`g+r`,`o-r somefile`

### Access Control List (ACL)

- Extend the traditional Linux access control model.
- Assign permissions to individual users/groups
- Coexist with the traditional permission model

### ACL Commands

## Running Command with Privilege

### Why

- Three command mechanisms
  - `sudo`
  - `Set-UID` programs (**covered in a separate chapter**)
  - `POSIX` capabilities

### Using Sudo

- `sudo`: Super-user Do
- Run commands as a superuser
- A user must be authorized (`/etc/sudoers`)
- Here is how the seed user is allowed to run sudo

![sudo](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1026691184002867220/1026702677167583272/unknown.png)

### Getting Root Shell

- Note:
  - In Ubuntu 20.04, the root user account is locked
  - Cannot log into the root account
  - There are many ways to get a root shell
    - `sudo –s`
    - `sudo bash`
    - `sudo su`
- Rule of Thumb:
  - It is not recommended to run commands using a root shell.
  - Instead, use sudo to run individual commands.

### Running Command Using Another User

- Run command using another user (instead of root, default)
- `-u` option

### POSIX Capabilities

- Divide the root privilege into smaller privilege units
- Known as capabilities
- Use “man capabilities” to find all the capabilities
- Examples:

![POSIX](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1026691184002867220/1026704135665500201/unknown.png)

### Example: ping

- The ping program
  - Uses raw socket that requires privilege.
  - Has the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability set.
  - `ping` program used to have `Set-UID` privilege.

```Bash
$ getcap /usr/bin/ping
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
```

## Authentication

### Authentication Methods

- A process to verify a user’s identity
- Typical authentication methods
  - based on something the **user knows**:
    - E.g.: password
  - based on something the **user has**:
    - E.G.: ID card
  - based on something the **user is or does**:
    - E.G.: biometrics
- Multi-factor authentication
  - 2FA can is considered secure, but it has been defeated by social engineering attacks that exploit human factors

### The Password File

- Each entry contains a user account information
- Password is not stored here (used to be)

![Password File](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1026691184002867220/1026705493785313360/unknown.png)

### The Shadow File

- Store password, why not use /etc/password anymore?
- Structure for each entry

### The Purpose of Salt

- Random string
- Defeat brute-force attacks
  - dictionary attack, rainbow table attack
- These 3 accounts have the same password

### Locking Account

- Invalid value in the password field (**!**)
- The root account is locked

`root:!:18590:0:99999:7:::`

### Summary

- The chapter present the basics (**fundamental**) aspects of the
OS security using Linux as a playground.
- It will pave the way for future topics.
