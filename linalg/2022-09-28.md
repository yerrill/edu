## Theorem 4.6.1

All bases for a finite‐dimensional vector space have the same number of vectors.

## Theorem 4.6.2

Let V be a finite‐dimensional vector space, and let ${v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}$ be any basis for $V$.

(a) If a set in $V$ has more than $n$ vectors, then it is linearly dependent.

(b) If a set in $V$ has fewer than $n$ vectors, then it does not span $V$.

## Definition 1

The dimension of a finite‐dimensional vector space $V$ is denoted by $dim(V)$ and is defined to be the number of vectors in a basis for $V$. In addition, the zero vector space is defined to have dimension zero.

## Theorem 4.6.3

Plus/Minus Theorem

Let $S$ be a nonempty set of vectors in a vector space $V$.

(a) If $S$ is a linearly independent set, and if $v$ is a vector in $V$ that is outside of $span(S)$, then the set $S \cup {v}$ that results by inserting $v$ into $$ is still linearly independent.

(b) If $v$ is a vector in $S$ that is expressible as a linear combination of other vectors in $S$, and if $S - {v}$ denotes the set obtained by removing $v$ from $S$, then $S$ and $S - {v}$ span the same space; that is,

$span(S) = span(S - {v})$

## Theorem 4.6.4

Let $V$ be an $n$‐dimensional vector space, and let $S$ be a set in $V$ with exactly $n$ vectors. Then $S$ is a basis for $V$ if and only if $S$ spans $V$ or $S$ is linearly independent.

## Theorem 4.6.5

Let $S$ be a finite set of vectors in a finite‐dimensional vector space $V$.

(a) If $S$ spans $V$ but is not a basis for $V$, then $S$ can be reduced to a basis for $V$ by removing appropriate vectors from $S$.

(b) If $S$ is a linearly independent set that is not already a basis for $V$, then $S$ can be enlarged to a basis for $V$ by inserting appropriate vectors into $S$.

## Theorem 4.6.6

If $W$ is a subspace of a finite‐dimensional vector space $V$, then:

(a): $W$ is finite‐dimensional.

(b): $dim(W) \leq dim(V)$.

(c): $W = V$ if and only if $dim(W) = dim(V)$.
