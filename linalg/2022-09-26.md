# Lecture 6 (2022-09-26) - Coordinates and Basis

Chapter 4.5

## Chapter Introduction

We usually think of a line as being one‐dimensional, a plane as two‐dimensional, and the space around us as three‐dimensional. It is the primary goal of this section and the next to make this intuitive notion of dimension precise. In this section we will discuss coordinate systems in general vector spaces and lay the groundwork for a precise definition of dimension in the next section.

## Coordinate Systems in Linear Algebra

In analytic geometry one uses rectangular coordinate systems to create a one‐to‐one correspondence between points in 2‐space and ordered pairs of real numbers and between points in 3‐space and ordered triples of real numbers.

Although rectangular coordinate systems are common, they are not essential.

Figure shows coordinate systems in 2‐space and 3‐space in which the coordinate axes are not mutually perpendicular.

In linear algebra coordinate systems are commonly specified using vectors rather than coordinate axes.

![Fig 4.5.3](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029586171283636257/unknown.png)

For example, in Figure we have re‐created the coordinate systems in Figure prior by using unit vectors to identify the positive directions and then attaching coordinates to a point $P$ using the scalar coefficients in the equations $OP = au_1 + bu_2$ and $OP = au_1 + bu_2 + cu_3$.

Units of measurement are essential ingredients of any coordinate system. In geometry problems one tries to use the same unit of measurement on all axes to avoid distorting the shapes of figures. This is less important in applications where coordinates represent physical quantities with diverse units (for example, time in seconds on one axis and temperature in degrees Celsius on another axis). To allow for this level of generality, we will relax the requirement that unit vectors be used to identify the positive directions and require only that those vectors be linearly independent. We will refer to these as the **“basis vectors”** for the coordinate system. In summary, it is the directions of the basis vectors that establish the positive directions, and it is the lengths of the basis vectors that establish the spacing between the integer points on the axes.

## Basis for a Vector Space

Our next goal is to extend the concepts of “basis vectors” and “coordinate systems” to general vector spaces, and for that purpose we will need some definitions. Vector spaces fall into two categories: A vector space $V$ is said to be ***finite‐dimensional*** if there is a finite set of vectors in $V$ that spans $V$ and is said to be ***infinite‐dimensional*** if no such set exists.

### Definition 1

If $S = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}$ is a set of vectors in a finite‐dimensional vector space $V$, then $S$ is called a ***basis*** for $V$ if:

***(a)***: $S$ spans $V$.

***(b)***: $S$ is linearly independent.

If you think of a basis as describing a coordinate system for a finite‐dimensional vector space $V$, then part ***(a)*** of this definition guarantees that there are enough basis vectors to provide coordinates for all vectors in $V$, and part ***(b)*** guarantees that there is no interrelationship between the basis vectors.

## Example 1 - The Standard Basis for $R^n$

Recall from Example 1 of Section 4.3 that the standard unit vectors

$$
e_1 = (1, 0, 0, ..., 0), e_2 = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0), e_n = (0, 0, 0, ..., 1)
$$

span $R^n$ and from Example 1 of Section 4.4 that they are linearly independent. Thus, they form a basis for $R^n$ that we call the ***standard basis*** for $R^n$. In particular,

$$
i = (1, 0), j = (0, 1)
$$

and

$$
i = (1, 0, 0), j = (0, 1, 0), k = (0, 0, 1)
$$

is the standard basis for $R^2$ and $R^3$, respectively.

## Example 2 - The Standard Basis for $P_n$

Show that $S = {1, x, x^2, ..., x^n}$ is a basis for the vector space $P_n$ of polynomials of degree $n$ or less.

**Solution:**

We must show that the polynomials in $S$ are linearly independent and span $P_n$. Let us denote these polynomials by

$$
p_0 = 1, p_1 = x, p_2 = x^2, ..., p_n = x^n
$$

We showed in Example 3 of Section 4.3 that these vectors span $P_n$ and in Example 4 of Section 4.4 that they are linearly independent. Thus, they form a basis for $P_n$ that we call the ***standard basis*** for $P_n$.

## Example 3 - Another Basis for $R^3$

Show that the vectors $v_1 = (1, 2, 1)$, $v_2 = (2, 9, 0)$, and $v_3 = (3, 3, 4)$ form a basis for $R^3$.

**Solution:**

We must show that these vectors are linearly independent and span $R^3$. To prove linear independence we must show that the vector equation

***(1)***: $c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + c_3 v_3 = 0$

has only the trivial solution; and to prove that the vectors span $R^3$ we must show that every vector $b = (b_1, b_2, b_3)$ in $R^3$ can be expressed as

***(2)***: $c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + c_3 v_3 = b$

By equating corresponding components on the two sides, these two equations can be expressed as the linear systems:

***(3)***

$c_1 + 2 c_2 + 3 c_3 = 0$

$2 c_1 + 9 c_2 + 3 c_3 = 0$

$c_1 + 0 c_2 + 4 c_3 = 0$

and

$c_1 + 2 c_2 + 3 c_3 = 0$

$2 c_1 + 9 c_2 + 3 c_3 = 0$

$c_1 + 0 c_2 + 4 c_3 = 0$

Thus, we have reduced the problem to showing that in ***(3)*** the homogeneous system has only the trivial solution and that the nonhomogeneous system is consistent for all values of $b_1$, $b_2$, and $b_3$. But the two systems have the same coefficient matrix

![Ex 3 Incident Matrix](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029801840457568266/unknown.png)

we can prove both results at the same time by showing that $det(A) \neq 0$. We leave it for you to confirm that $det(A) = -1$, which proves that the vectors $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$ form a basis for $R^3$.

Examples 1 and 3 show a vector space can have more than one basis.

## Example 4 - The Standard Basis for $M_{mn}$

Show that the matrices

![Ex4-1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029805034629767239/unknown.png)

form a basis for the vector space $M_{22}$ of $2 \times 2$ matrices.

**Solution:**

We must show that the matrices are linearly independent and span $M_{22}$. To prove linear independence we must show that the equation

***(4)***: $c_1 M_1 + c_2 M_2 + c_3 M_3 + c_4 M_4 = 0$

has only the trivial solution, where $0$ is the $2 \times 2$ zero matrix; and to prove that the matrices span $M_{22}$ we must show that every $2 \times 2$ matrix

![Ex4-2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029806735701057616/unknown.png)

can be expressed as

***(5)***: $c_1 M_1 + c_2 M_2 + c_3 M_3 + c_4 M_4 = B$

The matrix forms of Equations ***(4)*** and ***(5)*** are

![Ex4-3](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029807364393664602/unknown.png)

and

![Ex4-4](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029807651867070625/unknown.png)

which can be rewritten as

![Ex4-5](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029807908059369594/unknown.png)

Since the first equation has only the trivial solution

$c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = c_4 = 0$

the matrices are linearly independent, and since the second equation has the solution

$c_1 = a, c_2 = b, c_3 = c, c_4 = d$

the matrices span $M_{22}$. This proves that the matrices $M_1$, $M_2$, $M_3$, $M_4$ form a basis for $M_{22}$. More generally, the $mn$ different matrices whose entries are zero except for a single entry of 1 form a basis for $M_{mn}$ called the ***standard basis*** for $M_(mn)$.

**Note**: The simplest of all vector spaces is the zero vector space $V = {0}$. This space is finite‐dimensional because it is spanned by the vector $0$. However, it has no basis in the sense of Definition 1 because ${0}$ is not a linearly independent set. However, we will find it useful to define the empty set $0$ to be a basis for this vector space.

## Example 5 - An Infinite-Dimensional Vector Space

Show that the vector space of $P_{\infty}$ of all polynomials with real coefficients is infinite‐dimensional by showing that it has no finite spanning set.

**Solution:**

If there were a finite spanning set, say $S = {p_1, p_2, ..., p_r}$, then the degrees of the polynomials in $S$ would have a maximum value, say $n$; and this in turn would imply that any linear combination of the polynomials in $S$ would have degree at most $n$. Thus, there would be no way to express the polynomial $xn + 1$ as a linear combination of the polynomials in $S$, contradicting the fact that the vectors in $S$ span $P_{\infty}$.

## Example 6 - Some Finite- and Infinite-Dimensional Spaces

In Examples 1, 2, and 4 we found bases for $R^n$, $P_n$, and $M_{mn}$, so these vector spaces are finite‐dimensional. We showed in Example 5 that the vector space $P_{\infty}$ is not spanned by finitely many vectors and hence is infinite‐dimensional. Some other examples of infinite‐dimensional vector spaces are $R \infty$, $F(-\infty, \infty)$, $C(-\infty, \infty)$, $C^m (-\infty, \infty)$, and $C \infty (-\infty, \infty)$.

## Coordinates Relative to a Basis

Earlier in this section we drew an informal analogy between basis vectors and coordinate systems. Our next goal is to make this informal idea precise by defining the notion of a coordinate system in a general vector space. The following theorem will be our first step in that direction.

### Theorem 4.5.1

**Uniqueness of Basis Representation**: If $S = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}$ is a basis for a vector space $V$, then every vector $v$ in $V$ can be expressed in the form $v = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + ... + c_n v_n$ in exactly one way.

We now have all of the ingredients required to define the notion of “coordinates” in a general vector space V. For motivation, observe that in $R^3$, for example, the coordinates $(a, b, c)$ of a vector $v$ are precisely the coefficients in the formula

$$
v = ai + bj + ck
$$

that expresses v as a linear combination of the standard basis vectors for $R^3$ (see Figure). The following definition generalizes this idea.

![Fig 4.5.5](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029823971694231643/unknown.png)

Our next definition will generalize this idea, but first we need to make some observations about bases. Up to now the order of the vectors in a basis $S = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}$ for a vector space $V$ did not matter. The only requirement was that the vectors in the set $S$ be linearly independent and span $V$. However, in many cases the order in which the vectors in $S$ are listed matters. A basis in which the listed order of the vectors matters is called an ***ordered basis***. Thus, for example, if $S = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}$ is a basis for a vector space $V$, then $S′ = {v_2, v_1, …, v_n}$ is also a basis, but it is a different ordered basis.

### Definition 2

If $S = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}$ is an ordered basis for a vector space $V$, and

$$
v = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + ... + c_n v_n
$$

is the expression for a vector $v$ in terms of the basis $S$, then the scalars $c_1$, $c_2$, ..., $c_n$ are called the coordinates of $v$ relative to the basis $S$. The vector $(c1, c2, ..., cn)$ in $R^n$ constructed from these coordinates is called the coordinate vector of $v$ relative to $S$; it is denoted by

***(6)***: $(v)_S = (c_1, c_2, ..., c_n)$

Frequently, we will want to express ***(6)*** as a column matrix, in which case we will use the notation

![Def2-1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029825671146520576/unknown.png)

We call this the ***matrix form*** of the coordinate vector and ***(6)*** the ***comma‐delimited form***.

Observe that $(v)_S$ is a vector in $R^n$, so that once an ordered basis $S$ is given for a vector space $V$, Theorem 4.5.1 establishes a one‐to‐one correspondence between vectors in $V$ and vectors in $R^n$ (Figure).

![Def2-2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029826547630215259/unknown.png)

## Example 7 - Coordinates Relative to the Standard Basis of $R^n$

In the special case where $V = R^n$ and $S$ is the standard basis, the coordinate vector $(v)_S$ and the vector $v$ are the same; that is, $v = (v)_S$.

For example, in $R^3$ the representation of a vector $v = (a, b, c)$ as a linear combination of the vectors in the standard basis $S = {i, j, k}$ is $v = ai + bj + ck$.

So the coordinate vector relative to this basis is $(v)_S = (a, b, c)$, which is the same as the vector $v$.

## Example 8 - Coordinate Vectors Relative to Standard Bases

a. Find the coordinate vector for the polynomial

$p(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + ... + c_n x^n$

relative to the standard basis for the vector space $P_n$

b. Find the coordinate vector of

![Ex8-1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029828534702714880/unknown.png)

relative to the standard basis for $M_{22}$.

**Solution (a)**: The given formula for $p(x)$ expresses this polynomial as a linear combination of the standard basis vectors $S = {1, x, x^2, ..., x^n}$. Thus, the coordinate vector for $p$ relative to $S$ is $(p)_S = (c_0, c_1, c_2, ..., c_n)$.

**Solution (b)**: We showed in Example 4 that the representation of a vector

![Ex8-2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029829269339242666/unknown.png)

as a linear combination of the standard basis vectors is

![Ex8-3](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1018627774971396187/1029830447515041802/unknown.png)

so the coordinate vector of B relative to S is $(B)_S = (a, b, c, d)$.

## Example 9 - Coordinates in $R^3$

a. We showed in Example 3 that the vectors

$v_1 = (1, 2, 1)$, $v_2 = (2, 9, 0)$, and $v_3 = (3, 3, 4)$

form a basis for $R^3$. Find the coordinate vector of $v = (5, −1, 9)$ relative to the basis $S = {v_1, v_2, v_3}$.

b. Find the vector $v$ in R3 whose coordinate vector relative to $S$ is $(v)_S = (−1, 3, 2)$.

**Solution (a):** To find $(v)_S$ we must first express $v$ as a linear combination of the vectors in $S$; that is, we must find values of $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$ such that

$c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + c_3 v_3 = b$

or, in terms of components,

$(5, -1, 9) = c_1 (1, 2, 1) + c_2 (2, 9, 0) + c_3 (3, 3, 4)$

Equating corresponding components gives

$c_1 + 2 c_2 + 3 c_3 = 5$

$2 c_1 + 9 c_2 + 3 c_3 = -1$

$c_1 + 0 c_2 + 4 c_3 = 9$

Solving this system we obtain $c_1 = 1, c_2 = −1, c_3 = 2$ (verify). Therefore, $(v)_S = (1, -1, 2)$.

**Solution (b):** Using the definition of $(v)_S$, we obtain

$v = (-1) v_1 + 3 v_2 + 2 v_3$

$= (-1)(1, 2, 1) + 3(2, 9, 0) + 2(3, 3, 4) = (11, 31, 7)$
