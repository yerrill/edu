# Lecture 5 (2022-09-21) - Chapter 4.4

## Section Introduction

> In this section we will consider the question of whether the vectors in a given set are interrelated in the sense that one or more of them can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. This is important to know in applications because the existence of such relationships often signals that some kind of complication is likely to occur.

## Linear Independence and Dependence

In a rectangular xy‐coordinate system every vector in the plane can be expressed in exactly one way as a linear combination of the standard unit vectors. For example, the only way to express the vector $(3, 2)$ as a linear combination of $i = (1, 0)$ and $j = (0, 1)$ is **(1)**: $(3,2) = 3(1,0) + 2(0,1) = 3i + 2j$.

A plot using an arbitrary 45 degree axis can create new unit vectors but can also be expressed using normal unit vectors.

## Definition 1

If $S = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_r}$ is a set of two or more vectors in a vector space $V$, then $S$ is said to be a ***linearly independent set*** if no vector in $S$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. A set that is not linearly independent is said to be ***linearly dependent***. If $S$ has only one vector, we will agree that it is linearly independent if and only if that vector is nonzero.

## Theorem 4.4.1

A nonempty set $S = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_r}$ in a vector space $V$ is linearly independent if and only if the only coefficients satisfying the vector equation

$$
k_1 v_1 + k_2 v_2 + ... + k_r v_r = 0
$$

are $k_1, k_2, ..., k_r = 0$.

**Note**: In the case where the set $S$ in Definition 1 has only one vector, we will agree that $S$ is linearly independent if and only if that vector is nonzero.

## Example 5 - Linear Independence of Polynomials

The following example shows that the problem of determining whether a given set of vectors in $P_n$ is linearly independent or linearly dependent can be reduced to determining whether a certain set of vectors in $R^n$ is linearly dependent or independent.

## Theorem 4.4.2

**Note**: The following useful theorem is concerned with the linear independence and linear dependence of sets with one or two vectors and sets that contain the zero vector.

***(a)*** A set with finitely many vectors that contains $0$ is linearly dependent.

***(b)*** A set with exactly two vectors is linearly independent if and only if neither vector is a scalar multiple of the other.

## A Geometric Interpretation of Linear Independence

Linear independence has the following useful geometric interpretations in $R^2$ and $R^3$:

- Two vectors in $R_2$ or $R_3$ are linearly independent if and only if they do not lie on the same line when they have their initial points at the origin. Otherwise one would be a scalar multiple of the other.

- Three vectors in $R^3$ are linearly independent if and only if they do not lie in the same plane when they have their initial points at the origin. Otherwise at least one would be a linear combination of the other two.

## Theorem 4.4.3

**Note**: At the beginning of this section we observed that a third coordinate axis in $R^2$ is superfluous by showing that a unit vector along such an axis would have to be expressible as a linear combination of unit vectors along the positive $x$‐ and $y$‐axis. That result is a consequence of the next theorem, which shows that there can be at most $n$ vectors in any linearly independent set $R^n$.

Let $S = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_r}$ be a set of vectors in $R^n$. If $r \gt n, then $S$ is linearly dependent.
