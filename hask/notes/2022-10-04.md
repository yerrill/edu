## Patterns of Computation Over Lists

- Applying to all – mapping

```Haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map f xs = [f x | x <- xs]
```

- Selecting elements – filtering

```Haskell
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter p xs = [x | x<- xs, p x]
```

- Combing the items – folding

```Haskell
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr f s [] = s
foldr f s (x:xs) = f x (foldr f s xs)
```

## Folding

Binary (associative) operation `op` on a type `a` with neutral element `e`. (Examples: `(+,0)`, `(*,1)`, `(++,[])` , `(&&,True)`, `(||,False)`, `(.,id)`).

```Haskell
foldr op e [a0,a1,…,an-1,an]    -- ( or foldl ) 
--  = a0 `op` a1 `op` … `op` an-1 `op` an

foldr op e [] = e
```

Binary (associative) operation `op` on a type `a` (without a neutral element). (Examples: `max`, `min`, `lcm`, `gcd` ).

```Haskell
foldr1 op [a0,a1,…,an-1,an]     -- ( or foldl ) 
--  = a0 `op` a1 `op` … `op` an-1 `op` an

foldr1 op [] is not defined (causes an error)
```

If op is not associative the foldl and foldr versions may result in different functions.

Binary function with arguments from different types

Examples:

```Haskell
reverse :: [a] -> [a]
reverse = foldl (flip (:)) []

sort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
sort = foldr insert []

--  Notice that     foldr (flip (:)) [] and
--                  foldl insert []
--  don’t work.
```

## Generalization

Consider the following function:

```Haskell
getWord :: String -> String
getWord [] = []
getWord (x:xs)
    | isSpace x = []
    | otherwise = x : getWord xs
```

We can generalize this function to have a test – or property – as a parameter.

```Haskell
getUntil :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
getUntil ...

getWord = getUntil isSpace
```

## Functions as Values

Function composition

```Haskell
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
(f . g) x = f (g x)

infixl 9 >.>
(>.>) :: (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> c)
g >.> f = f . g
```

## Example: Creating an Index

Example:

Input:
`”cathedral doggerel cathedral\nbattery doggerel cathedral\n cathedral”`

Output:

```Text
    battery     2
    cathedral   1, 2, 3
    doggerel    1, 2
```

```Haskell
makeIndex :: Doc -> [([Int],Word)]

type Doc    = String
type Line   = String
type Word   = String

makeIndex =
    lines       >.>     -- Doc              -> [Line]
    numLines    >.>     -- [Line]           -> [(Int,Line)]
    allNumWords >.>     -- [(Int,Line)]     -> [(Int,Word)]
    sortLs      >.>     -- [(Int,Word)]     -> [(Int,Word)]
    makeLists   >.>     -- [(Int,Word)]     -> [([Int],Word)]
    amalgamate  >.>     -- [([Int],Word)]   -> [([Int],Word)]
    shorten             -- [([Int],Word)]   -> [([Int],Word)]
```
