Textbook not needed
No lab monday

# Lecture

Works on lambda calculus rather than Von Neumann model

Principles in notes (TODO: embed images)

Domain, range, and image (Actual produced values -> Not all natural numbers are squares)

Variables are not storage locations. Fit more of a math description, placeholder for an unknown value.

Type deffinitions not mandatory but are recommended

```Haskell
name :: type
name = expression
```

# TODO
- Install Haskell
