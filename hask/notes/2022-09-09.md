Course Description (Brock Calendar):                                                                  Introduction to functional programming using the languages Haskell. Topics include all data types, type inference, pattern-matching, recursion, polymorphism, higher-order functions, lazy vs eager evaluation, modules and monads.

## S6

- Von Neumann Model
  - Store with addressable locations
- Machine Code
  - Effect achieved by changing contents of store locations, instructions executed in sequence
  - Flow of control altered by jumps
- Imperative Language
  - variable corresponds to store location
  - instructions executed in sequence, flow of control altered by conditional and loop statements
  - efficient implementation since close to design of conventional computers

## Notes
Works on lambda calculus rather than Von Neumann model

## S6

- computational model: lambda calculus
- mathematical functions: domain, range
- functional languages achieve effect by applying functions
- functional vs. imperative languages
  - store location
  - assignment statement vs. application of a function (expressions)
    - side-effects
    - aliasing
    - referential transparency

Domain, range, and image (Actual produced values -> Not all natural numbers are squares)

## S10

Haskell definitions are of the form:
```Haskell
name :: type
name = expression
```

Examples:
```Haskell
size :: Int
size = (12+13)*4

square :: Int -> Int
square n = n*n
```

The definition of square uses a syntactic shorthand. 
```Haskell
square :: Int -> Int
square = \n -> n*n
```
where `\n -> n*n` is a lambda expression, i.e., the function mapping `n` to `n*n`


## Notes

Variables are not storage locations. Fit more of a math description, a placeholder for an unknown value.

Type definitions not mandatory but are recommended

```haskell
name :: type
name = expression
```
