```Haskell
look2 db b = maybe ("unknown item", 0) id
    (lookup b (map (\(x, y, z) -> (x, (y, x))) db))
```

```Haskell
replicate n x
    | n <= 0 = []
    | otherwise = x : replicate (n-1) x
    --           [x] ++ : replicate

```

`concatMap` is a combination of `concat` and `map` which are used together often.

```Haskell
noMultiples n [] = []
noMultiples n (x:xs)
    | x 'mod' n == 0 = noMultiples n xs
    | otherwise = x : noMultiples n xs
```
