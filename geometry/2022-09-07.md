## Thales

Five geometric theorems:

1. A circle is bisected by a diameter
2. The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal
3. The pairs of vertical angles formed by two intersecting lines are equal
4. Two triangles are congruent if they have two angles and the included side equal
5. An angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle

## Axiomatic Model

An axiom or postulate is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.

New concepts are introduced by making definitions.

Assertions about the model are stated as theorems and proved from the axioms.

Notes:

- Axiom/Postulate serves as base for new argument/assertions. Axiomatic model is a method of presentation, not discovery
- There is no distinction between two types of mutually accepted statements
- Axiom and postulate are used interchangeably to refer to a statement accepted without proof

Starting from a base of undefined terms and agreed upon axioms, we can define other terms and use our axioms to argue the truth of other statements.

These other statements are called the theorems of the system.

Our axiomatic system consists of four components:

1. Undefined Terms
2. Axioms (or Postulates)
3. Defined Terms
4. Theorems

## Example 1

Suppose that we had a situation where students enrolled in classes. Suppose we have the following rules (axioms) about students and classes.

Axioms:

- There are exactly three students
- For every pair of students, there is exactly one class in which they are enrolled
- Not all of the students belong to the same class
- Two separate classes share at least one student in common

Theorem: There are exactly three classes in our system.

Proof: By Axiom 2 we know that for each pair of students, there is a class. By Axiom 3 all three students cannot be in a common class. Thus, there must be at least three classes, say C1;C2;C3, as there are three different pairs of students. Suppose there is a fourth class, say C4. By the axiom A4, there must be a student shared by each pairing of C4 with one of the other three classes. So C4 has at least one student. It cannot contain all three students by Axiom 3. Also, it cannot have just one student since if it did, then classes C1;C2, and C3 would be forced by Axiom 4 to share this student and, in addition, to have three other, different students among them, because the three classes must have different pairs of students. This would mean that there are at least four students and would contradict Axiom 1. Thus, C4 must have exactly two students. But, since this pair
of students must already be in one of the other three classes, we have a contradiction to Axiom 2. Thus, there cannot be a fourth class.

## Example 2

Using example 1 axioms prove the new theory. Theorem:  Each class has exactly two students.
