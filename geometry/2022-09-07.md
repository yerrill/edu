## Thales

Five geometric theorems:

1. A circle is bisected by a diameter
2. The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal
3. The pairs of vertical angles formed by two intersecting lines are equal
4. Two triangles are congruent if they have two angles and the included side equal
5. An angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle

## Axiomatic Model

An axiom or postulate is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.

New concepts are introduced by making definitions.

Assertions about the model are stated as theorems and proved from the axioms.

Notes:

- Axiom/Postulate serves as base for new argument/assertions. Axiomatic model is a method of presentation, not discovery
- There is no distinction between two types of mutually accepted statements
- Axiom and postulate are used interchangeably to refer to a statement accepted without proof

Starting from a base of undefined terms and agreed upon axioms, we can define other terms and use our axioms to argue the truth of other statements.

These other statements are called the theorems of the system.

Our axiomatic system consists of four components:

1. Undefined Terms
2. Axioms (or Postulates)
3. Defined Terms
4. Theorems

## Example 1

Suppose that we had a situation where students enrolled in classes. Suppose we have the following rules (axioms) about students and classes.

Axioms:

- There are exactly three students
- For every pair of students, there is exactly one class in which they are enrolled
- Not all of the students belong to the same class
- Two separate classes share at least one student in common

Theorem: There are exactly three classes in our system.

Proof: By Axiom 2 we know that for each pair of students, there is a class. By Axiom 3 all three students cannot be in a common class. Thus, there must be at least three classes, say C1;C2;C3, as there are three different pairs of students. Suppose there is a fourth class, say C4. By the axiom A4, there must be a student shared by each pairing of C4 with one of the other three classes. So C4 has at least one student. It cannot contain all three students by Axiom 3. Also, it cannot have just one student since if it did, then classes C1;C2, and C3 would be forced by Axiom 4 to share this student and, in addition, to have three other, different students among them, because the three classes must have different pairs of students. This would mean that there are at least four students and would contradict Axiom 1. Thus, C4 must have exactly two students. But, since this pair
of students must already be in one of the other three classes, we have a contradiction to Axiom 2. Thus, there cannot be a fourth class.

## Example 2

Using example 1 axioms prove the new theory. Theorem:  Each class has exactly two students.

Proof: By the previous theorem we know that there are exactly three classes. By Axiom 4 we know that there is at least one student in a class. Suppose a class had just one student, call this student S. All classes would then have student S by Axiom 4. The other two students are in some class, call it class X, by Axiom 2. Class X must then have all three students as it also needs to have student S, the student common to all three classes. But, this contradicts Axiom 3. Thus, all classes must have at least two students and by Axiom 3 must have exactly two students.

## Peano's Axioms

In 1889 Giuseppe Peano published a set of axioms – the formal axiomatic basis for the natural numbers.

Let N stand for the set of all natural numbers in the following listing of Peano's axioms.

## Properties of Axiomatic Systems

We looked at an axiomatic system consisting of classes and students. We can re-label these terms without any real change in the structure of the system or in the relationships between the terms of the system.

In an axiomatic system, it does not matter what the terms represent. The only thing that matters is how the terms are related to each other. By giving the terms a specific meaning, we are creating an interpretation of the axiomatic system.

## Three Point Geometry

Uses same logic as students example.

Axioms:

1. There are exactly three points.
2. Two distinct points belong to one and only one line.
3. Not all of the points belong to the same line.
4. Two separate lines have at least one point in common.

## Axiomatic Model Properties

**Definition**: A model is an interpretation of the undefined terms of an axiomatic system such that all of the axioms are true statements in this new interpretation.

**Consistency** – Impossible to deduce from the axioms a new theorem that contradicts any axiom or previously proved theorem.

**Independence** – Each axiom cannot be logically deduced from the other axioms in the system.

**Completeness** – Impossible to add an additional consistent and independent axiom without adding additional undefined terms.

## Four-Point Geometry

**Undefined Terms**: point, line, lie on

Axioms:

1. There exist exactly four points. (This is an existence axiom)
2. Any two distinct points have exactly one line on both of them. (This is an incidence axiom)
3. Each line is on exactly two points. (This is an incidence axiom)

**Definition**: Two lines on the same point are said to intersect and are called intersecting lines.

**Definition**: Two lines that do not intersect are called parallel lines.

## Example 4

**Example**: Show that there are exactly six lines in Four-Point geometry

Consider four points A, B, C, D (A1). For every pair of points we have exactly one line (A2). Each line is on exactly two points (A3). By counting we can get that there is exactly 6 lines.

## Golden Ratio

The golden ratio, Greek letter Phi, approximately $1.618$.

We find the golden ratio when we divide a line into two parts so that: the whole length divided by the long part is also equal to the long part divided by the short part.

![Golden Ratio Calculation](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020053546412036177/unknown.png)

The Golden Ratio is equal to: $1.61803398874989484820...$ (etc.) The digits just keep on going, with no pattern. In fact the Golden Ratio is known to be an Irrational Number.

You can calculate it yourself by starting with any number and following these steps:

1. divide 1 by your number (=1/number)
2. add 1
3. that is your new number, start again at A

With a calculator, just keep pressing $1/x$, $+$, $1$, $=$, around and around.
