## Lines and Angles

Any two **point**s A and B determine a unique **line** $l$, denoted by $AB$. Two lines $l$ and $m$ intersect in at most one point. If $l$ do not intersect $m$, then we say that $l$ and $m$ are parallel lines, denoted by $l$ || $m$. On the other hand, if two (or more) lines intersect in one point the lines are said to be **concurrent**. Moreover, points on one line are called **collinear**.

## Theorem 1.1.1

If $l$ is a line and $P$ is a point not on $l$, then:

1. There is exactly one line through $P$ that is parallel to $l$.
2. There is exactly one line through $P$ that is perpendicular to $l$.

## Bisectors

A **bisector** of a **segment** is a line intersecting the segment at its midpoint. A **perpendicular bisector** of a segment is a line that is perpendicular to the segment at its midpoint. As a result, any point lies on the perpendicular bisector is equidistant (has equal distance) from the endpoints of the segment.

**Definition**: The degree measure of $\angle BAC$ will be denoted by $m \angle BAC$. We will say an angle is greater than another angle if its angle measure is greater than the other angle's measure.
