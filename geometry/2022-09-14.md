## Three Point Geometry

Axioms:

1. There exist exactly 3 points in this geometry
2. Two distinct points are on exactly one line
3. Not all the points of the geometry are on the same line
4. Two distinct lines are on at least one point

**Note**: Proving "exactly" theorems requires the inclusion-exclusion principle. Prove more and less than.

## Theorem 1 (TPG)

**Theorem**: Two distinct lines are on exactly one point.

## Theorem 1 (FLG)

**Theorem**: The four line geometry has exactly six points.

**Proof**:

- By axiom 2 and 3

## Theorem 2 (FLG)

**Theorem**: Each line of the four-line geometry has exactly 3 points on it.

**Proof**:

- Consider any line. The three other lines must each have a point in common with the given line. (Axiom 2)
- These three points are distinct, otherwise axiom 3 is violated.
- Then there are exactly 3 points on each line.

## Four Point Geometry

Axioms:

1. There exist exactly 4 points
2. Any two distinct points have exactly one line on both of them
3. Each line is on exactly two points

**Theorem 1** (From FLG): The four point geometry has exactly six lines.

**Theorem 2** (From FLG): Each point of the four point geometry has exactly 3 lines on it.

## Fano's Geometry

Axioms:

1. There exists at least one line
2. Every line of the geometry has exactly 3 points on it
3. Not all points of the geometry are on the same line
4. For two distinct points, there exists exactly one line on both of them
5. Each two lines have at least one point on both of them

![Fano's](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020065715748880504/unknown.png)

## Theorem 1 (Fano's)

**Theorem**: Each two lines have exactly one point in common.

**Proof**:

- Assume that two distinct lines have two distinct points in common. By Axiom 4 these two points would then be on two distinct lines.

## Theorem 2 (Fano's)

**Theorem**: Fano's Geometry consists of exactly seven points and seven lines.

**Proof**:

## Euclid's Axiomatic Geometry

The Elements:

- It is the second most widely published book in the world, after the Bible
- A cornerstone of mathematics, used in schools as a mathematics textbook up to the early 20th century
- The Elements is actually not a book at all, it has 13 volumes

The Greek mathematicians of Euclid’s time thought of geometry as an abstract model of the world in which they lived. The notions of point, line, plane (or surface) and so on were derived from what was seen around them. From studies of the space and solids in the space around them, an abstract geometrical notion of a solid object was developed.

A solid has shape, size, position, and can be moved from one place to another. Its boundaries are called surfaces. They separate one part of the space from another, and are said to have no thickness. The boundaries of the surfaces are curves or
straight lines. These lines end in points.

Consider the three steps from solids to points (solids-surfaces-lines-points). In each step we lose one extension, also called a dimension. So, a solid has three dimensions, a surface has two, a line has one and a point has none. Euclid summarized these statements as definitions.

He began his exposition by listing 23 definitions in Book 1 of the ‘Elements’. A few of them are given below :

1. A point is that which has no part.
2. A line is breadth less length.
3. The ends of a line are points.
4. A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.
5. A surface is that which has length and breadth only.
6. The edges of a surface are lines.
7. A plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself.

If you carefully study these definitions, you find that some of the terms like part, breadth, length, evenly, etc. need to be further explained clearly.

For example, consider his definition of a point. In this definition, ‘a part’ needs to be defined. Suppose if you
define ‘a part’ to be that which occupies ‘area’, again ‘an area’ needs to be defined. So, to define one thing, you need to define many other things, and you may get a long chain of definitions without an end. For such reasons, mathematicians agree to leave some geometric terms undefined. However, we do have a intuitive feeling for the
geometric concept of a point than what the ‘definition’ above gives us. So, we represent a point as a dot, even though a dot has some dimension.

A similar problem arises in Definition 2: A line is breadth less length.

It refers to breadth and length, neither of which has been defined. Because of this, a few terms are kept undefined while developing any course of study. So, in geometry, we take a point, a line and a plane (in Euclid‘s words a plane surface) as undefined terms. The only thing is that we can represent them intuitively, or explain them with the help of ‘physical models’.

Starting with his definitions, Euclid assumed certain properties, which were not to be proved. These assumptions are actually ‘obvious universal truths’.

He divided them into two types: axioms and postulates. He used the term ‘postulate’ for the assumptions
that were specific to geometry. Common notions (often called axioms), on the other hand, were assumptions used throughout mathematics and not specifically linked to geometry.

Some of Euclid’s axioms:

1. Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another.
2. If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.
3. If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
4. Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.
5. The whole is greater than the part.
6. Things which are double of the same things are equal to one another.
7. Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another.

These ‘common notions’ refer to magnitudes of some kind. The first common notion: Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another.

Could be applied to plane figures. For example, if an area of a triangle equals the area of a rectangle and the area of the rectangle equals that of a square, then the area of the triangle also equals the area of the square.

Magnitudes of the same kind can be compared and added, but magnitudes of different kinds cannot be compared. For example, a line cannot be added to a rectangle, nor can an angle be compared to a pentagon.

The 4th axiom: Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.

Seems to say that if two things are identical (that is, they are the same), then they are equal. In other words, everything equals itself. It is the justification of the principle of superposition.

Axiom (5): The whole is greater than the part.

Gives us the definition of ‘greater than’. For example, if a quantity B is a part of another quantity A, then A can be written as the sum of B and some third quantity C. Symbolically, A > B means that there is some C such that A = B + C.

## The Five Postulates of Geometry

1. “Let it be postulated to draw a straight line from any point to any point”
2. “to produce a limited straight line in a straight line,”
3. “to describe a circle with any center and distance,”
4. “that all right angles are equal to each other.”
5. “That if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.” (parallel postulate)

### Postulate 1

*A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point.*

Note that this postulate tells us that at least one straight line passes through two distinct points, but it does not say that there cannot be more than one such line. However, in his work, Euclid has frequently assumed, without mentioning, that there is a *unique* line joining two distinct points. We state this result in the form of an axiom as follows:

**Axiom 5.1**: Given two distinct points, there is a unique line that passes through them.

![Axiom 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020071092649463928/unknown.png)

### Postulate 2

*A terminated line can be produced indefinitely.*

Note that what we call a line segment now-a-days is what Euclid called a terminated line. So, according to the present day terms, the second postulate says that a line segment can be extended on either side to form a line.

![Axiom 2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020071602446155866/unknown.png)

### Postulate 3

*A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius.*

### Postulate 4

*All right angles are equal to one another.*

### Postulate 5

*If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the sum of angles is less that two right angles.*

![Postulate 5 image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020072394230083724/unknown.png)

After Euclid stated his postulates and axioms, he used them to prove other results. Then using these results, he proved some more results by applying deductive reasoning. The statements that were proved are called propositions or theorems.

Euclid deduced 465 propositions in a logical chain using his axioms, postulates, definitions and theorems proved earlier in the chain. In the next few chapters on geometry, you will be using these axioms to prove some theorems.

Let us see in some examples how Euclid used his axioms and postulates for proving some of the results.

## Euclid's Fifth Postulate

It was one of the most disputable topics in the history of mathematics. Many mathematicians considered that this postulate is in fact a theorem  and tried to prove it from the first four - and failed...

- John Playfair (1748 – 1819) -> Given a line and a point not on the line, there is a line through the point parallel to the given line
- John Wallis (1616-1703) -> To each triangle, there exists a similar triangle of arbitrary magnitude.
- Girolamo Saccheri (1667–1733) -> Proposed a radically new approach to the problem. Using the first 28 propositions, he assumed that the fifth postulate was false and then tried to derive a contradiction from this assumption. He had developed a body of theorems about a new geometry.

![P5 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020078123313790996/unknown.png)

![P5 2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020078226120376380/unknown.png)

This result can also be stated in the following form: Two distinct intersecting lines cannot be parallel to the same line.

Theorems Equivalent to the Parallel Postulate:

- In any triangle, the three angles sum to two right angles.
- In any triangle, each exterior angle equals the sum of the two remote interior angles.
- If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the alternate interior angles are equal, and the corresponding angles are equal.

Playfair’s Axiom: ‘For every line l and for every point P not lying on l, there exists a unique line m passing through P and parallel to l’.

## Euclidean Geometry

- The geometry in which the fifth postulate is true
- The interior angles of a triangle add up to 180º
- The circumference of a circle is equal to 2ΠR, where R is the radius
- Space is flat

## Propositions in The Elements

**Proposition I.1**: On a given finite straight line to construct an equilateral triangle.

- Let AB be the given line.
- Draw a circle with centre A having radius AB. (Postulate 3)
- Draw another circle with centre B having radius AB.
- Call the point of intersection of the two circles C.
- Connect AC and BC (Postulate 1).
- AB and AC are radii of the same circle and therefore equal to each other (Definition 15, of a circle).
- Likewise AB=BC.
- Since AB=AC and AB=BC, AC=BC (Common Notion 1).
- Therefore triangle ABC is equilateral (Definition 20, of an equilateral triangle). Q.E.D.

![Prop 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020079474387198013/unknown.png)

Proposition I.1 showed that given only the assumptions that Euclid already made, he is able to show that he can construct an equilateral triangle on any given line. He can therefore use constructed equilateral triangles in other proofs without having to justify that they can be drawn all over again.

**Proposition I.4**: If two triangles have two sides of one triangle equal to two sides of the other triangle plus the angle between the sides that are equal in each triangle is the same, then the two triangles are congruent.

![Prop 2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020079934527520848/unknown.png)

**Proposition I.14**: Two adjacent right angles make a straight line. Definition 10 asserted the converse, that a perpendicular erected on a straight line makes two right angles.

![Prop 3](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020080196428238878/unknown.png)

**Proposition I.41**: The area of a triangle is one half the area of a parallelogram with the same base and height.

![Prop 4](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020080376863010926/unknown.png)

Constructions that are required to prove -> **Proposition I.31**: Given a line and a point not on the line, a line through the point can be constructed parallel to the first line.

![Prop 5](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020080753884790784/unknown.png)

Constructions that are required to prove -> **Proposition I.46**: Given a straight line, a square can be constructed with the line as one side.

## Proposition I.47

*In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.*

![i47 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020081350071558165/unknown.png)

![i47 2](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020081571186868265/unknown.png)

- Draw a line parallel to the sides of the largest square, from the right angle vertex, A, to the far side of the triangle subtending it, L.
- Connect the points FC and AD, making ∆FBC and ΔABD.

![i47 3](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020081631802961970/unknown.png)

- The two shaded triangles are congruent (by Prop. I.4) because the shorter sides are respectively sides of the constructed squares and the angle between them is an angle of the original right triangle, plus a right angle from a square.

![i47 4](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020081770160472095/unknown.png)

- The shaded triangle has the same base (BD) as the shaded rectangle, and the same height (DL), so it has exactly half the area of the rectangle, by Proposition I.41.

![i47 5](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020081901916127232/unknown.png)

- Similarly, the other shaded triangle has half the area of the small square since it has the same base (FB) and height (GF).

![i47 6](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020082021860646983/unknown.png)

- Since the triangles had equal areas, twice their areas must also be equal to each other (Common notion 2), hence the shaded square and rectangle must also be equal to each other.

![i47 7](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020082152219623484/unknown.png)

- By the same reasoning, triangles constructed around the other non-right vertex of the original triangle can also be shown to be congruent.

![i47 8](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020082286491877406/unknown.png)

- And similarly, the other square and rectangle are also equal in area.

![i47 9](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1019351346362712084/1020082478440001687/unknown.png)

And finally, since the square across from the right angle consists of the two rectangles which have been shown equal to the squares on the sides of the right triangle, those squares together are equal in area to the square across from the right angle.
